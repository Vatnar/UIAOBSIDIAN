**Replay Review Checklist** :bar_chart:

1. **Initial Assessment** :mag:
   - **Game Situation**: Note score, time left, and context.
   - **Player Positioning**: Evaluate your and opponent’s positioning. Are you in the right spot?
   - **Ball Position**: Where is the ball relative to both players?
2. **Decision-Making Process** :thinking:
   - **1v1 Scenario**: Is this a 1v1?
     - **Yes**: Analyze the challenge.
     - **No**: Focus on team play/rotations.
3. **Challenge Decision** :arrows_counterclockwise:
   - **Did you challenge or wait?**
     - **Challenge**
       - **Timely?** (Did you jump or drive at the right moment?)
       - **Distance to the ball**: Too far or close?
       - **Opponent’s read**: Did you anticipate their move (flip reset, air bump)?
     - **Wait**
       - **Why wait?** (Good decision, unsure, missed chance?)
       - **React effectively?** (Did you counter their move?)
4. **Challenge Execution** :zap:
   - **What type of challenge?**
     - **Jumped early**
       - **Effectiveness**: Did this pressure or leave you vulnerable?
     - **Delayed jump**
       - **Outcome**: Did you read/respond to their action?
   - **Ball contact**: Was it effective enough to stop a shot or clear the ball?
5. **Aftermath** :arrows_counterclockwise:
   - **Play outcome**: Did you regain possession, cause turnover, or concede a goal?
   - **Follow-up actions**: Did you rotate, pressure the ball, or support a teammate?
   - **Post-challenge positioning**: Were you in a good spot or vulnerable?
6. **Learning Points** :chart_with_upwards_trend:
   - **Strengths**: What went well? (e.g., timing, positioning)
   - **Weaknesses**: What could improve? (e.g., challenge recognition, reading opponents)
   - **Next Steps**: Focus on specific areas in practice (e.g., challenge timing, reading plays).
