A spool folder is a directory on a computer where print jobs are temporarily stored before being sent to the printer. When a user sends a document to print, the operating system spools it into this folder, allowing the printer to process the job at its own pace. This ensures that print jobs are managed efficiently, preventing system slowdowns, and allowing users to continue working while their documents are queued for printing. Spooling also helps in managing multiple print requests simultaneously.
