# Web Browsers

### How Web Browsers Work

- Web browsers interpret HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to display web content.
- Browsers use the URL entered by the user to fetch data from web servers.
- Modern browsers hide parts of the URL for simplicity and security.
- Different browsers render content similarly due to adherence to web standards.
- Browsers communicate with servers using protocols like HTTP and HTTPS.

### Evolution of Web Browsers

- Web browsers have evolved to support multimedia, security features, and faster rendering.
- Examples include Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge.
- Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, defined early HTML, URLs, and HTTP.
- Browsers receive information from servers formatted in HTML for user display.

### Fetching Information

- Browsers obtain data using the URL, which includes the protocol, domain, and path.
- DNS (Domain Name System) translates domain names to IP addresses for server location.
- Tools like nslookup, dig, and resolvectl assist in DNS queries on different operating systems.

# HTML Basics

### HTML Overview

- HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language.
- It structures content with tags for headings, paragraphs, links, and images.
- HTML was defined by Tim Berners-Lee in 1989 for creating web pages.
- URLs and HTTP are fundamental components of the web.

### HTML Structure

- HTML combines hypertext (linked text) with markup (formatting instructions).
- Tags like <html>, <head>, and <body> organize content in a web page.
- HTML provides the foundation for creating interactive and visually appealing websites.

### HTML Elements

- Elements like <a> (anchor) and <img> (image) enhance user interaction.
- Attributes within tags modify element behavior or appearance.
- HTML5 introduced new elements for audio, video, canvas, and more.
- Web browsers render HTML elements to display content to users.

# Networking Fundamentals

### IP Addresses

- IP addresses are unique identifiers for devices on the internet.
- IPv4 (32-bit) and IPv6 (128-bit) are the current IP address standards.
- IPv4 uses dotted decimal notation, while IPv6 uses hexadecimal notation.
- DNS translates domain names to IP addresses for routing data over networks.

### IP Addressing and Subnetting

- IP addresses are divided into network and host portions.
- Subnet masks determine the network and host parts of an IP address.
- Routing directs IP packets between devices on the same or different subnets.
- Tools like nslookup, dig, and ip route assist in IP address management.

### Special IP Addresses

- Special IP ranges like loopback, network, and broadcast addresses serve specific purposes.
- Private IP addresses (RFC 1918) are reserved for internal networks.
- IPv6 addresses include local, link-local, and unique-local address types.
- IPv6 offers significantly more address space than IPv4 and includes built-in security features.
