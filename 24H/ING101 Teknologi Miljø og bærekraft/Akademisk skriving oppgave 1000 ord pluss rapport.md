## Historical Context and Development
- Briefly introduce the late 19th century as a period of rapid industrial and urban growth, focusing specifically on the need for improved communication systems in major cities.

## Technological Perspective of the Time
- Focus on the optimism around mechanization and the idea of technological progress.
- Highlight how pneumatic tubes fit into the contemporary vision of technology, being seen as an innovative solution for urban congestion and mail delays.

## Conditions That Enabled the Technology
- Sharpen this section by focusing on just two main enablers: urbanization (increased demand for fast communication) and advancements in engineering.
- Touch on investments by postal services or municipal governments as a secondary point.

## Impact on Mail Delivery
- Narrow down the focus to just mail delivery efficiency.
- Explore one or two case studies (e.g., London and New York) to illustrate how the system transformed urban communication.

## Legacy
- Conclude by discussing the short-lived success and eventual decline of pneumatic tubes.
- Emphasize their contribution to modern logistics systems, making a brief comparison to today's technologies like vacuum tubes in hospitals.
