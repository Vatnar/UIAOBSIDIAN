You need to make a plan that allows for unexpected things to happen.

### Make a schedule
Set up Your Semester Calendar (long-term)
- Block all important set time obligations.
### Use a diary (short-term)
- Check it at least three times a day.
- Develop a habit of writing everything in it to avoid double booking.
- Include start and end dates of assignments and other important goals. 
### Plan time for transition
- Allow switch of context
- Insert slack for your activities.
- Finishing and activity and starting another activity takes time (switching time).
- Be aware of (and avoid) parallel activities (multitasking)
