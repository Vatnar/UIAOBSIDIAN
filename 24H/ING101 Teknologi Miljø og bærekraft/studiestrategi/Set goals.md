- Make your goals specific and concrete.
	Don't vague.
- Set both long-term goals and short-term ones to support them
- Set a deadline for your goals and respect deadlines. 
	*Set your own deadlines, or multiple if it is a long deadline, plan it*
- Integrate your goals: school, personal and career.
- Realize that goals change but know which goals to stick to! Considr the consequences. **Prioritize**
