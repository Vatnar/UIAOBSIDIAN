# Introduksjon
No clear definition for discrete math.
In discrete mathematics
Continues mathematics
	Continuos numbers, 
In discrete mathematics we only consider discrete numbers.
No continous graphs,
In discrete its steps. ONly find y values for some x values.
No integration or differentiation, cause those are continous. 

Why?
Lot of application, main thing is logical thinking can be improved by following the course.
	Programming
	Algorithms Datastructures
	Databases Operating systems
	Security, encryption algorithm is discrete math
	AI, ML.

Example. Google Maps, google maps uses discret emath to find the shortest path. Graph Theory, last section of DISKMAT.
