# IoT basics
![[Pasted image 20250328103217.png|799x503]]
Hub is a central device, often has more storage and processing power than a microcontroller. Central point for connection. From the hub data can be polled for visualization, statistics, reports, and alarms. Report is a distilled version of the data, adapted for human reading. 

# IoT terms
**System administrator**
- Top-level user
- Only user with access to system configuration
- Can create *tenants*
- This is usually the engineer(s) responsible for the system
**Tenant**
- Top-level regular user
- The person responsible for customer, device and dashboard administration
**Customer**
- A paying customer that wants to access their data
- Customers can only see their own assets, devices and dashboard
**Asset**
- A location that can have devices
- Can be a city, building, ship, space station...
**Device**
- An actual IoT device reporting sensor values
# ThingsBoard
## ThingsBoard Example

- Composed of widgets
- Modular way of building a dashboard.
- Dashboard is a collection of widgets. 
	## ThingsBoard Architecture

### Protocols for communication
- **MQTT**, a more compact *HTTP* basically. More specific, and is designed for sensor reporting. 
- **CoAP** another option. 
### Rule Engine
- Look at data and perhaps process it.
- For instance one device might report in Celsius, and one in Fahrenheit. Then you will make a rule that converts Fahrenheit to Celsius.
### Core Services
- Process incoming data after rule engine.
- Saves to a database
- API for fetching data and statistics. 
### Rest API / Websocket
- Where you from python want to fetch data, you can use this.
- To interact with third party application. Remote procedure call **RPC**.
### WEB UI
- Where visualization are displayed.
- Website that is the view for the End User
### End User
- Administrator, and customer or developer.

## Running ThingsBoard Command
```bash
docker run -d -p 9090:9090 -p 1883:1883 -p 7070:7070 -p 5683-5688:5683-5688/udp -v tb-data:/data -v tb-logs:/var/log/thingsboard --name thingsboard --restart unless-stopped thingsboard/tb-postgres:3.9.1
```
