I made a Resource Chart for folks looking for this type of info and better ways of learning to find and read Sheet Music.

Here's the Resource Chart:

It's made for Absolute Beginners so hopefully you can find something that works for you.

I'll leave some more links to other Resources in regards to

Music Theory, To Refresh any Basics you might need,

Note Decoding, Getting better at Reading the Notes for each Clef,

Rhythm, so when you need to Read the Sheet Music the Rhythm won't hinder you,

and a comment I made for someone else in regards to Piano Playing Fundamentals.
