# Clock
![[Pasted image 20250307101836.png]]
- Hardware component that toggles a signal at a set speed
- Speed is measured in Hz, KHz, MHz
- 1Hz is 1 pulse a second
- Generated by external or internal oscillator
- Made from different materials, often quartz crystals. 

- Usage
- Used to control the speed of hardware.
- The speed of a CPU is set by a clock
- Control time sensitive functionality like i2c, SPI etc.
- Microcontrollers have multiple clock sources at different speeds and accuracies.

# Timers
![[Pasted image 20250307102555.png]]
- A hardware component that takes a clock and modifies it.
- A counter is a piece of hardware that receives these signals and counts them.
- Usually grouped, and called just Timers or Timers/Counters.
- Usage
- functions like delay, printf, or pwm, use timers internally.
