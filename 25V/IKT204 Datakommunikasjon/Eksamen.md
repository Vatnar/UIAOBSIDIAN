SEQ = Previous packed , SEQ + payload size
ACK = received packet SEQ + payload size

SEQ random first
Stop and wait vente på ACK

pipelining
instead of  waiting for ack, send continuously 
Server responds with ack of the packet its waiting for. 

TCP has 3 error handling mechanisms
- Timer
	- Timeout. 
- Cumulative ACK
	- If an ack is lost, client can see that the server responds for the next one. 
- Fast Transmit
	- Resends old ack value, duplicate ACKS. If 3 duplicate ACKS resend data.
	- If timers times out then its sent because of the timer instead.
	- After fast transmit can be selective ack or cumulative ack on this one
- Fast transmit pipelining

# 📘 IKT204 Exam Study Guide

## 🧱 1. Internet 5-layer Model

- Learn packet names per layer:
    
    - **Application**: _Message_
        
    - **Transport**: _Segment_
        
    - **Network**: _Datagram_
        
    - **Link**: _Frame_
        
    - **Physical**: _Bits_
        
- The entire set is called the **Protocol stack**.

## 🔍 2. Wireshark & TCP Session Analysis

- Identify protocols at each layer (Ethernet, IP, TCP, HTTP).
    
- Understand **window size**, **sequence numbers**, and **ACKs**.
    
- **Cookies**: small data stored by browser, exchanged in HTTP headers.
    
- Types of connections: _Persistent vs Non-persistent_.
    
- Packet analysis: find sender, client port, data bytes, number of routers (TTL), who closes connection.

## ⚙️ 4. DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)

- **Application layer**, **client-server protocol**.
    
- Assigns:
    
    - IP address
        
    - Subnet mask
        
    - Gateway (router)
        
    - Local DNS server
        
- Does **not** assign MAC, socket, or ISP DNS/TLD IPs.

## ✉️ 5. UDP Service Guarantees

- Offers **no guarantees**:
    
    - No reliability
        
    - No order

- Correct choice: **None of these**
    

---

## 📊 6. TCP Sequence & Retransmission

- Sequence and ACK numbers
    
- Reno variant: retransmits after **triple duplicate ACK**.
    
- Timeout = retransmit all **unacknowledged** segments.
    
- Out-of-order segments are **buffered**.
    

---

## 📉 7. TCP Congestion Control

- **Slow Start**, **Congestion Avoidance**, **Fast Recovery**
    
- AIMD: **Additive Increase**, **Multiplicative Decrease**
    
- Triple duplicate ACK → Fast Recovery
    
- Timeout → Slow Start
    
- Average throughput = `MSS / RTT * (3/4 * cwnd_max)`
    
- Know how cwnd evolves over time (sawtooth shape).
    

---

## 🧮 8. Subnetting (IPv4)

- Practice subnetting blocks like `85.175.130.0/23` into 4 equal parts.
    
- Understand **CIDR**, **prefix length**, and **host bits**.
    
- `2^host_bits - 2` = usable hosts per subnet.
    

---

## 🧭 9. Routing Protocols

- **BGP** = between Autonomous Systems
    
    - Uses **AS-PATH**
        
    - Called a **path vector** protocol
        
    - Prefix = **CIDR block**
        

---

## 🧾 10. Routing Table Matching

- Match destination IP to longest prefix in routing table.
    
- Convert dotted-decimal to binary if necessary.
    

---

## 📐 11. Dijkstra’s Algorithm (Link-State Routing)

- Understand steps of algorithm.
    
- Track:
    
    - Visited nodes `N'`
        
    - Distance `D(n)`
        
    - Predecessor `p(n)`
        
- Be familiar with notation: e.g., `D(v) = 6, p(v) = x` → `6x`

## 🧷 12. Ethernet and Switching

- IEEE standard: **802.3**

## ⏱️ 14. Delay Calculations

- **Frame length**: add payload + headers (TCP, IP, Ethernet)
