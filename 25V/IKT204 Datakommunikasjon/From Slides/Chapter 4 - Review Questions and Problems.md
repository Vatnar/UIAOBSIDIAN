**Exercise 1 (R3)**

We made a distinction between the forwarding function and the routing function performed in the network layer. What are the key differences between routing and forwarding?

Routing can be analogous to finding the overall route from point A to B using google maps. Routing is to determine the whole path. Forwarding can be analogous to taking each turn on your route, choosing turns.

**Exercise 2 (R17)**

Suppose Host A sends Host B a TCP segment encapsulated in an IP datagram. When Host B receives the datagram, how does the network layer in Host B know it should pass the segment (that is, the payload of the datagram) to TCP rather than to UDP or to some other upper-layer protocol?
