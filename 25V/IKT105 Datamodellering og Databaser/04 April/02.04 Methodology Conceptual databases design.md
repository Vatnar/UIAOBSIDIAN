OOA 
- The purpose of a design methodology.
- Database design has three main phases: conceptual, logical and physical design

**Conceptual**, non technical, in customers domain. Not necessarily databases. Uses UML.
**Logical**, Database model, SQL database model.
**Physical**, targets specific database, MySQL.

- Få fram views som trenger for enterprise. 
-  How to use Entity-Relationship (ER) modeling to build a conceptual data model based on the data requirements of an enterprise.
- How to validate the resultant conceptual model to ensure it is a true and accurate representation of the data requirements enterprise.

- How to document the process of conceptual database design
- End-users play an integral role throughout the process of conceptual database design

# Design methodology
- A structured approach that uses procedures, techniques, tools, and documentation aids to support and facilitate the process of design.
- Conceptual, logical and physical. Merge logical and physical in our case.
- Constructing a model of the data used in an enterprise, independent of all physical considerations.
- Logical database is independent of a particular DBMS and other physical integrations
- Physical is a description of the database, relations, indexes, so on.

## Success Factors
- Work interactively with the users as much as possible
- Follow a structured methodology throughout the data modeling process.
**VELDIG VIKTIG Å FØLGE METODEN**
- Employ a data-driven approach. 
- Structural and integrity considerations
- Combine conceptualization, normalization, and transaction validation techniques into the data modeling methodology.
- Data dictionary to supplement the data model diagrams.

- Be willing to repeat steps.

![[Chap16.pdf]]  **Guidelines to help make the selection:** 
• the candidate key with the minimal set of attributes 
• the candidate key that is least likely to have its values changed 
• the candidate key with fewest characters (for those with textual attribute(s))
• the candidate key with smallest maximum value (for those with numerical attribute(s))
• the candidate key that is easiest to use from the users’ point of view
• Strong vs weak entity 
• If you can assign an entity a primary key - the entity is referred to as being strong. 
• If you are unable to assign an entity a primary key – the entity is referred to as being weak. 
• Come back to this in step 2.1

32 Step 1 Build Conceptual Data 
• Step 1.6 Consider use of enhanced modeling concepts (optional step) 
• To consider the use of enhanced modeling concepts, such as specialization / generalization, aggregation, and composition. 
• Are there any such enhancement in our model?
• Do we have some entities that are similar – that share a lot of data? 
• Business owner and private owner 
• Staff and Supervisor
• Let’s update our model

- Translate Coceptual model into internal model
- Map objects in conceptual model to relational model
- Design components
	- Tables
	- Indexes
	- Views
	- Transactions

- How to derive a set of relations from a conceptual data model.
- How to validate these relations using the technique of normalization.
- How to validate a logical data model to ensure it supports the required transaactions.
- How to merge local logiclal data models based on one or more user views into a global logical data model that represents all user views.
- How to ensure that the final logical data model is a true and accurate representation of the data requirements of the enterprise

- Logical database design must account for every element on a system input and output.

## Step 2 Build and validate logical data model
- To translate the conceptual data model into a logical data model and then to validate this model to check that it is structurally correct using normalization and supports the required transactions.
- Step 2.1 Derive relationsfor logical data model
	- To create relations for the logical data model to represent the entities, relationships, and attributes that have been identified.

he following structures may occur in a conceptual data model: • (1) strong entity types • (2) weak entity types • (3) one-to-many (1:*) binary relationship types • (4) one-to-one (1:1) binary relationship types • (5) one-to-one (1:1) recursive relationship types • (6) superclass/subclass relationship types • (7) many-to-many (*:*) binary relationship types • (8) complex relationship types • (9) multi-valued attributes.

(1)Strong entity types Definition: an entity type that is not existence-dependent on some other another entity
(2) Weak entity types Definition: an entity type that is existence-dependent on some other entity type#

• (3) One-to-many (1:*) binary relationship types 
• For each 1:* binary relationship, the entity on the ‘one side’ of the relationship is designated as the parent entity and the entity on the ‘many side’ is designated as the child entity. To represent this relationship, post a copy of the primary key attribute(s) of parent entity into the relation representing the child entity, to act as a foreign key. • “Add the primary key (attribute or attributes) of the entity on one side of the relationship as the foreign key on the many side”. • The one side migrates to the many side.

## Multi-valued attributes
- Create a new relation to repsresent the attribute and include primary key of the entity in new relation, to act as a foreign key.
- Unljess the multi-valued attribute is itself an alternate key of the entity, <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">the primary key of the new relation is the combination of the multi-valued attribute and the primary key of the entity.</span> OIOIOIOIOIOIOIIIIOOOIIOOIOIIIOOOOI

> Step 2.4 Check integrity constraints • To check integrity constraints are represented in the logical data model. This includes identifying: • Required data – must have value, not null • Attribute domain constraints – sex, M, F • Multiplicity – constraint, branch have more than 3 phone numbers, branch has many staff members and staff works at single branch. • Entity integrity – primary key cannot hold null • Referential integrity – primary key of foreign key must exist, must be of same type • General constraints – ex staff not managing more than 100 properties.
