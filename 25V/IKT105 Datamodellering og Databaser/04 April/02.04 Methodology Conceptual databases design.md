- The purpose of a design methodology.
- Database design has three main phases: conceptual, logical and physical design

**Conceptual**, non technical, in customers domain. Not necessarily databases. Uses UML.
**Logical**, Database model, SQL database model.
**Physical**, targets specific database, MySQL.

- Få fram views som trenger for enterprise. 
-  How to use Entity-Relationship (ER) modeling to build a conceptual data model based on the data requirements of an enterprise.
- How to validate the resultant conceptual model to ensure it is a true and accurate representation of the data requirements enterprise.

- How to document the process of conceptual database design
- End-users play an integral role throughout the process of conceptual database design

# Design methodology
- A structured approach that uses procedures, techniques, tools, and documentation aids to support and facilitate the process of design.
- Conceptual, logical and physical. Merge logical and physical in our case.
- Constructing a model of the data used in an enterprise, independent of all physical considerations.
- Logical database is independent of a particular DBMS and other physical integrations
- Physical is a description of the database, relations, indexes, so on.

## Success Factors
- Work interactively with the users as much as possible
- Follow a structured methodology throughout the data modeling process.
**VELDIG VIKTIG Å FØLGE METODEN**
- Employ a data-driven approach. 
- Structural and integrity considerations
- Combine conceptualization, normalization, and transaction validation techniques into the data modeling methodology.
- Data dictionary to supplement the data model diagrams.

- Be willing to repeat steps.

![[Chap16.pdf]]  **Guidelines to help make the selection:** 
• the candidate key with the minimal set of attributes 
• the candidate key that is least likely to have its values changed 
• the candidate key with fewest characters (for those with textual attribute(s))
• the candidate key with smallest maximum value (for those with numerical attribute(s))
• the candidate key that is easiest to use from the users’ point of view
• Strong vs weak entity 
• If you can assign an entity a primary key - the entity is referred to as being strong. 
• If you are unable to assign an entity a primary key – the entity is referred to as being weak. 
• Come back to this in step 2.1

32 Step 1 Build Conceptual Data 
• Step 1.6 Consider use of enhanced modeling concepts (optional step) 
• To consider the use of enhanced modeling concepts, such as specialization / generalization, aggregation, and composition. 
• Are there any such enhancement in our model?
• Do we have some entities that are similar – that share a lot of data? 
• Business owner and private owner 
• Staff and Supervisor
• Let’s update our model
