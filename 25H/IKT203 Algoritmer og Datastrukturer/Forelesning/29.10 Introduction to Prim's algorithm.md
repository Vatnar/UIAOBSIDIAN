Solve the "Network Problem"
Cheapest total cost in a MST (Minimum spanning tree)
Greedy algorithm. (Greedy because it claims something is the cheapest at the start, when it doesn't know, it makes the logical optimal choice at each step)
Dijkstra' algorithm is also greedy.


Prims:
Real world problem, you need to connect multiple cities with fiber optic cables for the lowest possible total cost, you don't need to connect every city to the other, just all need to be connected to network.
