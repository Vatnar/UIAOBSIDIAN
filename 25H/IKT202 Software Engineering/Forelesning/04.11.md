- The architecture should feature well-defined modules whose functional responsibilities are assigned on the principles of information hiding and separation of concerns.
	- The information-hiding modules should encapsulate things likely to change
	- Each module should have a well-defined interface that encapsulate or hides the changeable aspects from other software.(SOLID) [[Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)]]
	- Avoid tight coupling. Especially regarding things subject to change. Don't create non-needed dependencies. Avoid functional and logical coupling. For instance tax calculation, don't hard code the tax rate. make sure we can change it one place.
- Unless your requirements are unprecedented your quality attributes should be achieved using well-known architectural patterns and tactics specific to each attribute.
