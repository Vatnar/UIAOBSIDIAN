Middleware
MQTT, CORBA, DDS.

MQTT
Broker, that runs somewhere, that is connected to a network.
MQTT Clientz which a module communicates too. The mqtt client talks to the mqtt broker.
The bus is the mqtt clients and broker. 

We also have DDS which is brokerless.

SQA
- Observe that document standrrds, processes and procedures are followed as enforced by the observer
SQC
+ Validate the quality of a system, and to check whether the application adheres to the defined quality or not
Testing
+ The activities that ensures the identification of bugs errors defects in software
Verification vs defect testing
+ First goal leads to verification testing
	+ Very the requiremeents - ensure that the system does what was prescribed
	+ Postivie testing
	+ To demonstrate to the developer and tehe system customer that the software meets its requiremenets
	+ A successful test shows that the system operates as intendet.
+ Second goal leads to defect testing
	+ Ensure the system does not do other operation then what is prescribed
	+ Negative testing
	+ Designed to find these.

Advantages
+ Provide us a quick and reliable way to find weakness in the system. 
+ Structured test cases represent various scenarios in the code, and give us a quick way to explore the areas that are difficult to analyse and verify.
