#### Main UML specification 
 - Superstructure
	 - Defines the UML elements (diagram, etc.)
- Infrastructure
	- Defines the UML core metamodel
- OCL (Object constraint language):
	- Formal language for writing predicates, constraints, and formulas inside diagrams
- XMI (XML Metadata Interchange):
	- DTD for UML models
- UML Diagram Interchange: XMI + graphic info
### Structure and behaviour
- UML focuses on two aspects of object oriented models: structure and behaviour.
- It aims at visualizing both.

#### Describing the structure of software
- The description of structure offers an account of what a system is made of, in terms of both its parts and the relationship among htem.
- A structure may be a hierarchy featuring one to many relationships, a network featuring many to many, or a lattice featuring connections between components that are neighbours in space.

**Module vs component**
- Module - detailed implementation description. Focusing on inner structure and "use" structure
- Component, high level description, used early in design phase.
Module static structure
Component runtime structure
