Agile-waterfall

### Software development methos
- Method = work strategy
- waterfall method 
	- Unidirectional, finish this step before moving to the next
	- Iterative + incremenntal (concept)
		- Development increment on functionality, repeat in a feedback loop
- Agile (concept/philosophy)
	-  continius user feedback essential, feedback loops on several iterations
- Scrum (framework)

#### Waterfall method
Sign off, cant move along before a phase is signed off

##### Phases
- Requirements analysis and definition
- System and software design
- Implementation and unit testing
- Integration and system testing
- Operation and maintenance

- Main drawback: Difficulty of accommodating change after the process is underway. In principle, a phase has to be complete before moving onto the next phase.
##### Problems
- Inflexible partitioning of the project into distinct stages makes it difficult to respond to changing customer requirements.
	- Model is only appropriate when the requirements are well-understood and changes will be fairly limited during the design process
	- Few business systems have stable requirementskk
