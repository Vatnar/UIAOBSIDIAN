# Requirements
#### User requirements
 To solve user requirements we need **functional requirements**

#### Business requirements
- You can only take 3 exams in one course
- A constraint
- Packets sent should not go through North Korea.
- We will run on Windows
- <span style="color:rgb(192, 0, 0)">Constraints are stricter requirements

- Non functional requirements decorate function requirements
	Quality attributes / performance / availability / security

A **requirement** specifies a need or want that that the user will be able to perform using the system-to-be in different situations or contexts, and the kind of experience the user will have during this work

- A business requirement describes why an organisation is implementing the system,. Usually described as a goal. Tightly coupled to orgs vision.

- User requirements describe goal or tasks the user must be able to achieve
- Functional requirements specify any prescribed behaviour by the system under a specific condition
- These parameters, decide what the system does, and how to respond to inputs

### Requirements engineering phases
##### Requirements gathering
- Requirements elicitation, helps the customer to define what is required what is to be accomplished, how the system will fit into the needs.
#### Requirements analysis 
- Refining and modifying the gathered requirements
- Mutually exclusive requirements, working against each other
#### Requirements specification
- unique id, 

Then repeat


### Requirements Elicitation techniques
#### Interviews
- Tradition source of requirements
- Interviews with an expert that can excel your domain
- One to one or small group more buy-in
#### Workshop
- Encourage stakeholder to collaborate in finding requirements
- Activates several types of stakeholders
- More resource intensive than interviews
#### Focus group
- Group of representatives that will aid in the requirement elicitation
- Best with a highly diverse group
#### Observation
- Interviews may lead to under precise description
- Observation can validate information collected from other sources.
- Time consuming, may not be suitable for every task.
- Can be both silent and interactive.

##### Questionnaires
- Survey large groups
- Inexpensive, but challenging to define well-written questions
- Often a good input to other elicitation techniques

### Requirements analysis
- Not a single step but:
- Refining the requirements to ensure that all stakeholders understand them
- Scrutinising the requirements for errors, emissions, and other deficiencies
- Decomposing high level requirements
- Feasibility analysis
- Model the requirements - visual models as a contrast to textual representation
- Analyse the requirements between systems to be build and the outside world
	- Often called context modelling
- Allocate requirements to subsystems


1. Define business requirements
2. Identify user classes
3. Identify user representatives
4. Identify requirements decision makers
5. Plan elicitation
6. Identify user requirements
7. Prioritise user requirement
