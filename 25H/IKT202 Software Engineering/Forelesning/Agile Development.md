### Agile
##### Agile "promise"
- Customer value can be delivered with each increment so system functionality is available earlier.
- Early increments act as a prototype to help elicit requirements for later increments
- Lower risk of overall project failure.

##### Agile Problems
- Most systems require a set of basic facilities that are used by different parts of the system
	- As requirements are not defined in detail until an increment is to be implemented, it can be hard to identify common facilities that are needed by all increments
	- Cross cutting concerns
		- Spotify: Family subscription went up in price, they find a new technique for more money or something. 
- Iterative processes -> specs is developed in conjunction with the software
	- Conflicts with the procurement model, where complete system specs is part of contract
- Difficult to predict cost
- Customer is accepting more risk with more involvement
	- Ref IBM vs SVV
- This is completely opposite as with f.ex a handyworker fixing something at your house.
	- This is because quality in Software is not well defined, while this is well defined in labour work of h√•ndverkting
