### Agile
##### Agile "promise"
- Customer value can be delivered with each increment so system functionality is available earlier.
- Early increments act as a prototype to help elicit requirements for later increments
- Lower risk of overall project failure.

##### Agile Problems
- Most systems require a set of basic facilities that are used by different parts of the system
	- As requirements are not defined in detail until an increment is to be implemented, it can be hard to identify common facilities that are needed by all increments
	- Cross cutting concerns
