# Component and Connector Views
- Usage: show how the system works and its behaviour in runtime. 
	- Particularly used for performance and availability quality attributes.
- Process view
	- Actual threads/processes of the system
- Concurrency View
	- Logical threads
- Shared Data View
	- How data is stored and accessed
- Client/server view
	- Multiple components talk to a common component for the same action
C&C Component and Connector

**Module View**
- Usage: Document a systems principals units of implementations
- Elements
	- Modules, which are implementation units of software that provide a coherent set of responsibilities
	- A class, collection of classes, layer, .dll, .jar (not really since the class is allocated to that dll)
		It should have said package.
- Relations:
	- Is part of, which defines a part/whole relationship between the sub-module - the part - and the aggregate module -- the whole.
	- Depends on, etc

Sub package, circle with arrow.

Module structures
- Decompose - module into sub modules. Pieces related to the whole
- Uses: -one module expects another to be present.
- Layer -decomposition in which there is an ordering.
- class - specialisation relationship.

Module (Static) vs component (runtime) view.
Decomposition: Client server, layered.
Client server view.
We need both to see we can have 2 tiers.


### Allocation View
- Document relationship between a systems software and its development or execution environment
- Reasoning about performance, availability, security, and safety.
- Reasoning about distributed development and allocation of work to teams.
- Reasoning about concurrent access to software versions.
