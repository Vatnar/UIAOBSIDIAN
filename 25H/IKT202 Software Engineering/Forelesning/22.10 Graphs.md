All trees are graphs.

But hierarchy is not required

**Graph Terminology**
V: Vertex
E: Edge

G = (V, E)
V: Set of elements/vertices/nodes
E: Set of edges.

**Undirected vs. Directed**
- Undirected: Edge goes both ways
- Directed: Edge goes one way.

**Unweighted vs. Weighted**
- Weighted: Cost of traversing an edge
- Unweighted: No cost associated.

**Degree**
Amount of edges connected to a vertex
- Helps us find important nodes
- Nodes with high degree are often called hubs

**In-Degree out-Degree**
- Directed graph
- In-degree is more used

**Two key problems - Network vs. Route**
- Find all nodes within a path
- Find paths within a set of nodes
- 1. Network: Find everything that is connected but with the minimum possible total cost
- 2. Route: How to get from point A to point B with the minimum possible cost:
