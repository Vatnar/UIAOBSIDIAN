All trees are graphs.

But hierarchy is not required
**Graph Terminology**
V: Vertex
E: Edge

G = (V, E)
V: Set of elements/vertices/nodes
E: Set of edges.

**Undirected vs. Directed**
- Undirected: Edge goes both ways
- Directed: Edge goes one way.

**Unweighted vs. Weighted**
- Weighted: Cost of traversing an edge
- Unweighted: No cost associated.
**Degree**
Amount of edges connected to a vertex
- Helps us find important nodes
- Nodes with high degree are often called hubs
- 
**In-Degree out-Degree**
- Directed graph
- In-degree is more used
