Have at least one diagram per use case flow, per level

##### Sequence diagram
- Fully Specify a use case
- Can show use cases at different levels
- Maps functionality of use case onto the object model

Entity: Would be in a database
Controller: does something with entities.
Boundary class: at the edge of a system to communicate

##### Key ideas of OO modeling
- Abstraction
	- Hide minor details so to focus on major details
- Encapsulation
	- Modularity: principle of separation of functional concerns
	- Information-hiding: principle of separation of design decision
- Relationships
	- Association: relationship between objects or classes
	- Inheritance: relationship between classes, useful to represent
	- Generalization or specializations of objects
