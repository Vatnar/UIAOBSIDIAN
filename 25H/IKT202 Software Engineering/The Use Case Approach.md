#### The Use Case Approach
1. Find the concept requirements of the system
	1. State the name of the concept requirement, verb object
	2. Provide a short description of the concept requirement of feature
2. Identify the actor
	1. An actor is a person that interacts with the system, or an external system itself
	2. Primary actor - the role that initiate the use case.
	3. Supporting actor - actors that are needed to fulfil the use case.
3. For each actor, find out:
	1. What they need from the system (probably already part of the pool of concepts in item 1)
	2. Any other interactions they expect to have with the system
	3. Which use case have what priority for them
4. If the pool of concepts requirements are not empty:
	1. Do you have all the appropriate actors?
	2. Are some of there concepts requirements system requirements?
	3. Are some of there concepts requirements non-functional requirements?
	4. Are some of there concepts requirements constraints?
