- The architecture should feature well-defined modules whose functional responsibilities are assigned on the principles of information hiding and separation of concerns.
	- The information-hiding modules should encapsulate things likely to change
	- Each module should have a well-defined interface that encapsulate or hides the changeable aspects from other software.(SOLID) [[Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)]]
	- Avoid tight coupling. Especially regarding things subject to change. Don't create non-needed dependencies. Avoid functional and logical coupling. For instance tax calculation, don't hard code the tax rate. make sure we can change it one place.
- Unless your requirements are unprecedented your quality attributes should be achieved using well-known architectural patterns and tactics specific to each attribute.
- The architecture should never depend on a particular version of a commercial product or tool. If it must, it should be structured so that changing to a different version is straightforward and inexpensive. <span style="color:rgb(192, 0, 0)">Build wrappers towards dependencies.</span> <span style="color:rgb(192, 0, 0)">Don't marry the version.</span> If we change version in the future, its easy to change, change it one place. All of this regards modifiable. It should be your goal.
- Modules that produce data should be separate from modules that consume data.
	- This tends to increase modifiable
	- Changes are frequently confined to either the production or the consumption side of data.
	- If its tightly coupled, less scalable. For instance if the producer needed a lot of dependency. 
- Don't expect a one-to-one correspondence between modules and components. Module (static (diagram), from a client, you can see those modules), but you can have many clients, then that's the runtime version. Then we have components.
- Every process should be written so that its assignment to a specific processor can be easily changed, perhaps even at runtime.
- The architecture should feature a small number of ways for components to interact.
	- The system should to the same things in the same way throughout.
	- This will aid in understanability, reduce development time, increase reliability, and enhance modifiability. (Conceptual Integrity)
The architecture should contain a specific (and small) set of resource contention areas, the resolution of which is clearly specified and maintained.
