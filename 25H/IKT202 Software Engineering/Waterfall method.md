### Waterfall method
Sign off, cant move along before a phase is signed off

##### Phases
- Requirements analysis and definition
- System and software design
- Implementation and unit testing
- Integration and system testing
- Operation and maintenance

- Main drawback: Difficulty of accommodating change after the process is underway. In principle, a phase has to be complete before moving onto the next phase.
##### Problems
- Inflexible partitioning of the project into distinct stages makes it difficult to respond to changing customer requirements.
	- Model is only appropriate when the requirements are well-understood and changes will be fairly limited during the design process
	- Few business systems have stable requirements
- The waterfall model is mostly used for large systems engineering projects where a system is developed at several sites.
	- Embedded system where software interface with hardware
	- Critical systems where safety and security is important
	- large software systems, many companies/partners and several sites
