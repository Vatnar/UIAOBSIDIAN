##### User stories vs Use case
- Story is a brief explanation of what a user wants from product
- More surface level, what a user wants to do. 
- What a user should be able to perform early.
- Use case stronger push towards the systems ability, to perform early.
	- The system should have fields for firstname, middlename and lastname
- Use cases contains more context, and provides a more detailed prescription of how the system should work
	- List of all the steps the user need to take to reach their goal
- The system should support `feature`
- We will focus on feature requirements with use cases.
- They are not mutual exclusive, a user story can be a starting point for use cases.
