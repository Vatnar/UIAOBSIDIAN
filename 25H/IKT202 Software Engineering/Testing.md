Acceptance Tests
You write it first, run it last
- Success criteria
	- The requirements are met as expected
- An acceptance test describes whether the system will pass or fail the test, given specific input values
- We cannot ever guarantee 100% coverage of all usage scenarios, but systematic approach can increase the expected degree of coverage.

- Each requirement describes for a given situation the output or behaviour of the system will produce
	- The output represents the users need or business goal
